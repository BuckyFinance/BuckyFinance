## Chainlink Local

Chainlink Local is an installable dependency. It provides a tool (the Chainlink Local Simulator) that developers import into their Foundry and Hardhat scripts. This tool runs [Chainlink CCIP](https://docs.chain.link/ccip) locally which means developers can rapidly explore, prototype and iterate CCIP dApps off-chain, and move to testnet only when they're ready to test in a live environment.

The package exposes a set of smart contracts and scripts with which you build, deploy and execute CCIP token transfers and arbitrary messages on a local Hardhat or Anvil (Foundry) development node. Chainlink Local also supports forked nodes.

User Contracts tested with Chainlink Local can be deployed to test networks without any modifications.

### Installation

Install the package by running:

#### Foundry (git)

```
forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-local
```

and then set remappings to: `@chainlink/local/=lib/chainlink-local/` in either `remappings.txt` or `foundry.toml` file

#### Hardhat (npm)

```
npm install git+https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-local.git
```

#### Remix IDE

```solidity
import "https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-local/blob/main/src/ccip/CCIPLocalSimulator.sol";
```

### Usage

Import `CCIPLocalSimulator.sol` inside your tests or scripts, for example:

```solidity
// test/demo.t.sol

pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import {Test, console2} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {IRouterClient, WETH9, LinkToken, BurnMintERC677Helper} from "@chainlink/local/src/ccip/CCIPLocalSimulator.sol";
import {CCIPLocalSimulator} from "@chainlink/local/src/ccip/CCIPLocalSimulator.sol";

contract Demo is Test {
    CCIPLocalSimulator public ccipLocalSimulator;

    function setUp() public {
        ccipLocalSimulator = new CCIPLocalSimulator();

        (
            uint64 chainSelector,
            IRouterClient sourceRouter,
            IRouterClient destinationRouter,
            WETH9 wrappedNative,
            LinkToken linkToken,
            BurnMintERC677Helper ccipBnM,
            BurnMintERC677Helper ccipLnM
        ) = ccipLocalSimulator.configuration();


        ccipLocalSimulator.requestLinkFromFaucet(receiver, amount);
    }

}
```
